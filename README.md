# Differentially Private Pedestrian Anonymization

## Introduction

**Differentially Private Pedestrian Anonymization** provides an anonymous synthesis method of differentially private pedestrian with consistent utility. In this method, the differential privacy is applied to the identity mapping from the delegation dataset $\mathcal{S}$ to the original pedestrian image $\mathcal{I}$, and anonymized dataset $\mathcal{T}$ is generated by utility consistent pose transformation model.
