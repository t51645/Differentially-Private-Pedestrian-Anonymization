# Differentially Private Pedestrian Anonymization

## Introduction

**Differentially Private Pedestrian Anonymization** provides an anonymous synthesis method of differentially private pedestrian with consistent utility. In this method, the differential privacy is applied to the identity mapping from the delegation pedestrian image dataset to the original pedestrian image dateset, and anonymized pedestrian image dataset is generated by utility consistent pose transformation model.
